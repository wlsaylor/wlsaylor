I'm starting a second act: working towards becoming a full stack web developer. I remember learning some rudimentary skills back in the Geocities days, but didn't catch the coding bug until recently. I started out with online tutorials learning the web development basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

With Cedar Mountain Software I have found a great opportunity to dig into learning MySQL and Symfony. I leverage my skill carried over from retail to help create flexible solutions for our clients.

I recently started learning with Promineo Tech to better my web development skills. In their 18 week front end boot camp, I am learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.js.
